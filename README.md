This small repository contains a LaTeX Preamble with settings for Computer Science handins together with a document with examples of use of all the different packages in the preamble together with a template to get a new document started quicker.

# Preamble
The preamble is made in two parts, with the intent to divide the settings between the general and the localization specific settings. This is only of value, should you write your .tex document in various languages.
- base: Packages and most settings
- dk/en: Settings specifically for localization to danish (dk) or english (en).

When importing the preamble you have to only import the localized .tex file, since there's already a call to the base settings within both. How you import it depends on where you have the preamble files located compared to your document.

# Documents
This repository the following four documents

## handin.tex
A sparse template to use for handins in different courses.

## article.tex
A sparse template for an academic article

## project.tex
A sparse template for a bigger project

## examples.tex
This is a a slowly growing document with explanations and examples of using the various packages in the preamble. They are all made with the intent to be reverse engineerable.

# Python Template Generator
In the folder Python you can find a Python Template Generator, created by Kristian 'Yurippe' Gausel. *prepare.py* is the file that creates *latexgen.py* and packs the template and the *preamble_en*, *preamble_dk* and *preamble_base* into *latexgen.py* to create a standalone script to generate a template from

This is especially useful for ShareLatTeX since you can add a --zip argument to zip the template into a ShareLaTeX compatible format for easy upload.

The *latexgen.py* file can be found under [Releases](https://github.com/SSoelvsten/LaTeX-Preamble_and_Examples/releases)

## Notice
This script has not been updated for the new refactored multi-file preamble and does not currently work.
